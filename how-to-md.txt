YAML front matter headers have been removed from all markdown files.

All markdown content now starts directly with the main heading (# Title).

The process_md.py script is no longer used as headers have been removed.
If you need to restore headers in the future, you can use process_md.py.

To remove headers from new markdown files, use remove_headers.py script.
